# Advanced Feature Engineering

Several methods are described for advanced feature engineering including:
* Resampling Imbalanced Data using SMOTE
* Creating New Features with Deep Feature Synthesis
* Handling Missing Values with the Iterative Imputer and CatBoost
* Outlier Detection with IsolationForest
