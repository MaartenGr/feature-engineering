> Code and instructions for techniques to creating new features, detecting outliers, handling imbalanced data, and impute missing values.

In this repo, you will find the code and instructions for [this article](https://towardsdatascience.com/4-tips-for-advanced-feature-engineering-and-preprocessing-ec11575c09ea?source=friends_link&sk=730bc6c0fa54ee30c395882be47353ad). It is advised to read through the article whilst coding along using the **Engineering Tips.ipynb** notebook. 

This repo and the corresponding article describe several methods for advanced feature engineering including:
* Resampling Imbalanced Data using SMOTE
* Creating New Features with Deep Feature Synthesis
* Handling Missing Values with the Iterative Imputer and CatBoost
* Outlier Detection with IsolationForest
